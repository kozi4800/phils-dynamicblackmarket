Black Market Guide for Players

Welcome to the Black Market in our RedM server! This guide will help you understand how to find and use the black market to buy and sell items.

What is the Black Market?

The Black Market is a special NPC vendor where you can buy unique items and sell your inventory for cash. Unlike regular shops, the Black Market moves to different locations and has dynamic prices that change over time, so stay sharp!

How to Find the Black Market





Check Your Map: Look for a yellow cash bag icon labeled "Black Market" on your map. This blip shows the current location of the Black Market.



Follow Notifications: When the Black Market moves to a new spot, you'll receive an in-game notification with the message: "Black market has moved to a new location!" Check your map to find the new position.



Look for the NPC: The Black Market is run by a special NPC (vendor) at the marked location. Approach the NPC to interact with them.

Using the Black Market

When you approach the Black Market NPC, you’ll have two interaction options:

1. Open Market





What it does: Opens the Black Market shop where you can buy exclusive items.



How to use: Interact with the NPC and select "Open Market" (look for the dollar icon).



Tip: Check the shop regularly, as the items and prices may change based on market conditions.

2. Sell Items





What it does: Lets you sell items from your inventory for cash.



How to use:





Interact with the NPC and select "Sell Items" (look for the dollar-sign icon).



A menu will pop up listing the items in your inventory that can be sold.



Each item shows:





The item name.



The amount you have.



The current sell price per item (prices may vary due to dynamic market updates).



Select an item, then enter the quantity you want to sell in the input box.



Confirm to complete the sale.



Note: If you don’t have any items to sell, you’ll see a notification: "You have no items to sell!" If you enter an invalid amount, you’ll get an error: "Invalid amount!"

Dynamic Pricing





The Black Market has dynamic prices that can change over time. When prices update, you’ll receive a notification: "Black market prices have been updated!"



Some items may have special prices, while others use a default sell price. Check the sell menu for the latest prices before selling.

Tips for Players





Stay Alert for Location Changes: The Black Market moves periodically, so keep an eye on your map and notifications to find it.



Check Prices: Since prices can change, compare the sell price in the menu to decide if it’s a good time to sell your items.



Inventory Management: Make sure you have items in your inventory before trying to sell, or you’ll get an error.



Visit Regularly: The Black Market offers unique items not found in regular shops, so check it often for new stock.

Troubleshooting





Can’t find the Black Market? Ensure you’re logged in and check your map for the yellow cash bag blip. If it’s not there, it may have moved recently—wait for a notification.



No items in the sell menu? This means your inventory doesn’t have items the Black Market accepts. Try collecting more items and check again.



Invalid amount error? Make sure the number of items you’re trying to sell is between 1 and the amount you own.

Enjoy trading at the Black Market, and happy outlawing!
